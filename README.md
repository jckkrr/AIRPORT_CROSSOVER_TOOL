# airport_compare
OSINT investigators wish they could get access to flight records. This doesn't do that, but it does show which planes landed and took off on the same day from an airport.

It utilise API feeds from Open Sky Network and HexDB.io, and builds and merges databases to return the details on any aircraft that may have been at a location for a meeting.

Works best for smaller aiports.
